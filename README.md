# toGather
An event discovery app that connects users with like-minded people to attend events together.

toGather was inspired by the challenge of meeting new people and finding great events, especially in a new city or when looking to expand your social circle. The app makes event discovery effortless by allowing users to swipe on events theyâ€™re interested in and automatically matching them with others who share the same interests. Group chats are instantly created to help users connect, plan, and attend events togetherâ€”making every outing more memorable.

## Key Features
- ðŸŽ« **Effortless Event Discovery**: Swipe left or right to browse events happening near you.
- ðŸ’¬ **Instant Group Chats**: Get automatically added to group chats with others interested in the same events to coordinate plans seamlessly.
- ðŸ‘¥ **Profile Customization**: Update your location and set event preferences to find the best matches.
- ðŸ“² **Notifications**: Receive alerts when a new group chat is created, so you never miss an opportunity to connect.

## Development
